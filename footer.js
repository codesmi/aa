All it took was two to three days a week to see results, and I was able to fit it in while my newborn and two-year-old napped.</p><p >Do each exercise for the desired amount of reps, quickly moving from one to the next. When you get to the end, take a 30- to 60-second break and then repeat, cycling through the routine a total of two or three times. I typically did this workout for 10 minutes and increased my time as my fitness improved.</p><p >Note: Always warm-up for three to five minutes with low-intensity aerobic activity before starting this routine. Also, if you want to add intensity to this routine, sprinkle in three to five-minute cardio intervals at the end of each round.</p>"
